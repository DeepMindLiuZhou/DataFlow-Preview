Rather than imitating Hammer\u2019s modernization of Gothic classics, Amicus developed its own niche with omnibus films. They were successful enough to be in full-fledged production for a decade, establishing a reputation as the go-to studio for horror anthologies. This, their introductory portmanteau film, clearly influenced by EC Comics, sets a pattern of to-be-expected unevenness. Still, Amicus installs themselves as a horror studio to be reckoned with, sparing no expense in procuring Hammer\u2019s top actors: Peter Cushing (who would star in all but one of the Amicus anthologies) and Christopher Lee. For its wraparound segment, Dr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors opens to the duo (among other passengers) on a train. Dr. Schreck ((\u201cShreck\u201d is German for \u201cterror,\u201d and a nod to the famous star of F.W. Murnau\u2018s Nosferatu.)) (Cushing, saddled with a terrible German accent and glued on brows) pulls out a deck of tarot cards. \u201cPick a card, any card, and tape it three times,\u201d Schreck tells his fellow passengers. Each participant will hear of a fate that may await them. Among the passengers is Christopher Lee who will, of course, factor into one of the five narratives.\nIn \u201cWerewolf,\u201d Neil McCallum is an architect renovating an old dark house, which turns out to be cursed. The title monster is featured in this pedestrian tale of ancestral revenge with a \u201ctwist.\u201d\nWith Alan Freeman (better known as the U.K D.J. for \u201cPick of the Pops\u201d) served up as a snack for a venus fly trap, \u201cThe Creeping Vine,\u201d thankfully doesn\u2019t take itself so seriously. It is refreshingly lightheaded hokum.\n\u201cVoodoo\u201d is the worst of the lot; badly dated in its stereotypes, with Kenny Lynch belting out a stolen voodoo tune.\n\u201cDisembodied Hand,\u201d has elitist art critic Franklin Marsh (Lee) driving artist Eric Landor (Michael Gough) to suicide. Landor\u2019s severed hand returns to exact revenge on the mean critic. It\u2019s in the spirit of The Beast with Five Fingers, among others, and chock-full of two-dimensional caricatures of both artists and critics. It holds no surprises, but with Lee and Gough engaged in a bit of whistling-while-they-work fun, it\u2019s easily the best episode.\n\u201cVampire\u201d feature a young Donald Sutherland who discovers he is married to\u2026 a vampire! It barely raises a pulse.\nSeen today, Dr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors is more camp than horror, and its appeal is one of genre nostalgia. Still, the phenomenal box office success of Dr. Terror green-lighted a second portmanteau film in 1967, entitled Torture Garden (directed by Freddie Francis and written by Robert Bloch). It contains no torture nor any garden. Burgess Meredith (in a preposterous disguise, reminding us of the Penguin) is Old Nick himself, going by the pseudonym of Dr. Diablo and moonlighting as a carnival barker who promises a tortuous exhibit that can reveal the future. \u201cYou\u2019ll shake, you\u2019ll shiver, but it\u2019s all good fun,\u201d Diablo hammily tells his patrons. Unfortunately, only one of the four tales lives up to that promise.\n\u201cEnoch,\u201d is the opening narrative. Michael Bryant\u2019s inheritance money (from an uncle who took his time dying) is going to be spoiled by a mean ol\u2019 puddy tat with a lot of doubloons.\n\u201cOver Hollywood\u201d has Beverly Adams discovering the fountain of youth in Hollywood with robotic consequences.\n\u201cMr. Steinway\u201d might be seen as a poor precursor to Stephen King\u2019s \u201cChristine,\u201d replacing a killer car with a killer piano. It\u2019s as absurd as it sounds.\nThe first three segments are sloppily written and executed with little enthusiasm; each progressively worse, but the final segment single-handedly salvages the anthology.\n\u201cThe Man Who Collected Poe\u201d finds Jack Palance (playing against type) as an Edgar Allan Poe-obsessed geek who may have found his soulmate in fellow fanatic Peter Cushing. However, somebody\u2019s got something\u2014or someone\u2014hidden in the basement and \u2026 somebody\u2019s got the fever, which leads to a fiery finale. Cushing and Palance clearly enjoyed playing opposite one another and their chemistry, along with clever writing, making one wish the previous segments had been as enjoyable.\n1970\u2019s The House That Dripped Blood (directed by Peter Duffell and written by Robert Bloch) is a considerable improvement over its predecessors. Duffell lacks the visual astuteness of Freddie Francis, but he has superior stories to work with and a top notch cast. The connecting theme is the titular house, which has a bit of baggage left over from all who have resided there.\nIn \u201cMethod For Murder,\u201d Denholm Elliott is a horror author who writes a character that becomes a tad too three-dimensional, much to his wife\u2019s peril.\n\u201cWaxworks\u201d stars Cushing as an uptight retired stockbroker and lifelong bachelor who visits a wax museum, only to see a figure of a woman whom he once was in love with. Obsession and unrequited love naturally go hand-in-hand, or head-on-plate.\nIn \u201cSweets to the Sweet,\u201d Nyree Dawn Porter is hired to tutor a young, motherless child (Chloe Franks) who is unloved by her cold-hearted father, Christopher Lee. Without giving too much away, let\u2019s just say the underlying theme is one few filmmakers would dare tackle today.\n\u201cThe Cloak\u201d is the most famous of the four episodes, remembered fondly for its absurd humor. It stars John Pertwee (best known for his portrayal of Dr. Who) as an actor who mantles the cloak of a purported actual vampire. Hammer favorite Ingrid Pitt bares her fangs and, of course, a bit more.\nAll four episodes feature strong acting, which is a rarity in contemporary horror and should be a model for genre filmmakers. Elliot\u2019s restrained performance in \u201cMethod For Murder\u201d is admirable enough to forgive the predictable \u201ctwist.\u201d The stylish \u201cWaxworks\u201d features an equally stylish performance from Cushing, although narratively it is the thinnest episode. \u201cSweets to the Sweet\u201d is psychologically intense with three powerhouse performances, making it the strongest entry. Although John Pertwee is a bit on-the-sleeve in \u201cThe Cloak,\u201d his performance suits the tone; but, he\u2019s no match for Pitt.\nAsylum (1972, directed by Roy Ward Baker and written by Robert Bloch) is often cited as the best of the Amicus anthologies. It opens on Dr. Martin (Robert Powell, best known as the blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon savior plopped into the Middle East in Franco Zeferelli\u2019s Jesus of Nazareth) showing up for his scheduled job interview with Dr. Starr for a position at the Dunsmoor Asylum. Martin is met by Dr. Rutherford (Patrick Magee), however, and informed that Dr. Starr is now a patient after going insane and becoming violent. Rutherford devises a test for Martin: he will interview four patients and if he can guess which one is Dr. Starr, then he will be hired. Naturally, this segues into four tales from Mr. Bloch.\nIn \u201cFrozen Fear,\u201d Walter (Richard Todd) is having a sordid affair with Bonnie (Barbara Parkins). When his wife Ruth (Sylvia Syms) won\u2019t give him a divorce, Walter grabs an axe and fills his basement freezer with prime ex-wife cold cuts. Little does Walter know that the wifey was a voodoo priestess, and when that freezer thaws, big things come a-crawling in small packages\u2014lots of them. This vignette is the most blatantly indebted to EC comics and, as such, it\u2019s probably Amicus\u2019 finest twenty minutes.\n\u201cThe Weird Tailor\u201d opens with tailor Bruno (Barry Morse) on the verge of being evicted. As luck would have it, Mr. Smith (Peter Cushing) walks into Bruno\u2019s shop and orders a unique suit. With the promise of a hefty commission, Bruno obsessively begins working according to Mr. Smith\u2019s very specific instructions. Unknown to Bruno, the suit is meant to resurrect Mr. Smith\u2019s recently deceased son. Things don\u2019t go according to plan. Previously adapted for Boris Karloff\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d, this one can\u2019t match the TV effort. Given a shorter running time for Asylum, Bloch was forced to excise the prologue, and with it gone, the suspense and menace are diminished. The original thriller was actually more perverse in suggesting Bruno\u2019s wife\u2019s sexual attraction to a mannequin. Additionally, Bruno\u2019s character was less sympathetic, bringing a pronounced, and weird, abusive quality that is merely sketched here. Cushing is superb, bringing a sense of pathos to the character, but his part is little more than a cameo. Being more compressed, the schlock quality of the ending is more pronounced. Yet, for all of its comparative flaws, this is a strong second episode.\n\u201cLucy Comes To Stay\u201d is the weakest of the four episodes. Barbara (Charlotte Rampling) has been released from the asylum to the care of her brother, George (James Valliers) and nurse Higgins (Megs Jenkins). However, Barbara has an imaginary friend named Lucy (Britt Ekland) who doesn\u2019t care for George or the nurse. Lucy is also handy with a knife. Disappointingly, it plays out exactly as expected, and isn\u2019t helped by lackluster performances (Rampling being the exception).\nSurprisingly, \u201cMannequins of Horror\u201d is an extension of the wraparound, with the arrival of a new doctor named Byron (Herbert Lom) who has the demonic hobby of placing spirits within miniature robots and imbuing them with life, which serves as a potential gateway to immortality. Dr. Martin returns to uncover Dr. Starr\u2019s identity in a delightfully unpleasant ending. It\u2019s something of a mini-masterpiece that clearly proved an inspiration to later, albeit inferior films.\nPART TWO will begin with Tales From The Crypt (1972) and take us to the final Amicus anthology: From Beyond The Grave (1974).\nAnthologyChristopher LeeFreddie FrancisHorrorPeter CushingPeter DuffellRoy Ward Baker\nPrevious Post271.

The proposed regulations, when approved, could force automakers to reduce tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. The latter are intimately related to global warming. Parenthetically, the state is aiming to reduce 30 percent of harmful gas emissions by passing stringent auto regulations.\nCalifornia represents about 10 per cent of the overall American auto market. Auto analysts expect that if the proposed regulations are adopted later this year after the review process, it would be the very first limits in the United States regarding auto emissions of gasses linked to global warming. In addition, other states in the nation are expected to follow same regulations to further promote the wellbeing of its citizens and their environment. At least four Northeastern states are observing what California is currently doing.\nThe California Air Resources Board, the one responsible of the proposed regulations, said that the stringent emission regulation is made in response to a state law enacted in 2002. Said law requires automakers to produce cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans that emit 30 per cent less greenhouse gases on average by 2015.\nThe proposed regulations are expected to increase the market value of new vehicles. However, the boards did not go into specifics by divulging the anticipated increase. With the proposed regulations, automotive emission parts are expected to become expensive due to the upgrades and innovations to come up with reduced greenhouse gases emissions. On the one hand, automakers are trying to prevent the proposal from becoming a law. California's actions have tremendous repercussions for the auto industry because the state represents about 10 per cent of the nation's car market.\nThe proposal entails added expenditures to automakers because of the required studies, testing, materials and modifications. Consequently, there is no assurance of a greener pasture attributed to the enhancements of emission control parts.\nThe upgrades needed to meet California's proposed regulations could add thousands of dollars to the price of a new vehicle, said Eron Shosteck of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. \"We are happy to offer these efficient fuel-saving technologies. But consumers just don't want to buy them... Automakers believe consumers should have the option to choose.\" He added that the regulations would result in vehicles that are \"lighter, smaller, less powerful, and less able to do what consumers want.\"\nCalifornia has the dirtiest air in America. This is the very reason why several movements have been established to take care of the matter. In addition to these cause-oriented movements, the state's Air Resources Board is also determined to promote a cleaner air to preclude illness and other hazardous effects of global warming.\nGlobal warming, the continuous increase of Earth's temperature, is said to be mostly attributable to human activities that results to increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, a colorless gas that rises into the atmosphere and traps heat. The situation further leads to warming of the atmosphere by escalating the greenhouse effect.\nGlobal warming influences both the natural environment and human life. Its effects include sea level rise, agricultural repercussions, thinning of the ozone layer, extreme weather events and spread of disease like malaria and other infectious maladies.\nCalifornia officials said automakers could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by improving gas mileage. Less fuel consumption would result in fewer emissions. They further noted that gas mileage could be improved with available technology, such as high-tech transmissions that shift automatically into the most efficient gear.\nAbout the Author: Joe Thompson is the owner of a successful auto body shop in Ferndale, California.

It passes through some of Switzerland\u2019s most picturesque landscapes and is available for travel in both winter and summer. A train ride through the Swiss Alps is beautiful at any time of the year.\nItalian high-speed trains are booked and have dynamic prices, cheaper in advance than on the day. The reservation opens up to 4 months in advance, depending on the train. Normally, you will need to change trains at least once if you want to travel from Chur to Tirano on these regular local trains.\nAt its highest point, the train is 7392 feet above sea level. You can also book your one-way trip with the Bernina Express and then use the regional trains to reach your next destinations, which would be included in your Swiss Travel Pass. I would also suggest doing this if you plan to get on and off the train. You will have to pay for seats again to return to one of the normal trains, as your tickets will only apply to the panoramic train. It seems that the windows of the normal wagons of the regional train open, but from what I could see, I could not reach those cars from where I was sitting. You can also stop at one of the small towns along the way to get a closer look.\nIn less than four hours, you\u2019ll experience the historic mountain passes of Albula and Bernina, the famous Landwasser Viaduct, with endless views on either side of the train as you twist and turn through the landscape. The 6 limestone arches with the red train, which travel through them, are iconic and became a symbol of scenic train rides in Switzerland and Europe. Shortly after leaving Tirano, the Bernina Express begins to drive through the streets while cars stay at traffic lights, allowing it to pass. The train then climbs up the valley just outside Tirano and continues all the way to the mountainside thousands of meters above sea level. Ospizio Bernina is the summit and highest point of the route at 2,253 meters above sea level.\nTravel with the Bernina Express can also be booked to/from Chur. This sensational scenic drive takes you along some of Switzerland\u2019s most beautiful routes, such as the Golden Pass, Glacier Express, and Bernina Express. In Interlaken you travel to the top of Europe: the Jungfraujoch. Day 2, travel from Zurich to Chur by Swiss InterCity train, then from Chur to Tirano on the fantastic Bernina Express, then Tirano to Milan by regional train trenord, as seen in the previous schedule. You can use the morning train all year round or the evening train in summer. This is the 3-car Allegra unit, coupled with the panoramic cars of the Bernina Express.\nThis is a regional ticket with a fixed price, tickets cannot be sold out, the reservation is not necessary or possible, so you can safely buy close to the departure date, without having to commit your money in advance. In fact, tickets can be purchased at the station on the day itself at this price if you wish. You can avoid paying a reservation fee if you travel in the non-reserved seats on the Allegra unit with the Bernina Express. Since the whole trip only takes 4 hours, you can easily do it in one day.\nThe Express is an hour and a half by train from Zurich and runs all year round. After a break of a few hours, the train departs from Tirano station, making its way through the Treno rosso del Bernina town of Tirano and back along the same route before arriving back in Chur in the late afternoon. The whole trip takes a whole day to complete and can start at both ends.\n2nd Class1st classSingle travel63101Tour116222Sterreservering+10 CHF+ 10 CHFImportantly, as shown in the table, an additional CHF 10 will be charged for seat reservation. These seat reservations can be booked in advance, we recommend this. Booking fees vary depending on the season you are travelling. If you want to travel on the Bernina Express during the cheapest time of the year, we recommend that you travel from November to January/February. It is recommended to reserve a seat if you are travelling during peak hours or want to guarantee a seat on board the daily express trains. You can reserve your seat at a Swiss train station or online.\nTaxis are also not a viable option, as the journey takes several hours. The best way to get from Milan to St. Moritz is via a combination train and bus, which takes about 4.5 hours when all is said and done. You can take a train from Milano Centrale station to Chiavenna, and then change to bus line 4 to St. Moritz Bahnhof. The bus we were travelling in was bad with a clear mechanical problem from the moment we boarded in Milan.\nThey pride themselves on the Bernina Express going from glacial landscapes to palm-friendly climates within hours. They speak enthusiastically about the 7,638 meter high Bernina Pass. And they can\u2019t help mentioning the line\u2019s impressive tunnels and viaducts.

To accelerate progress, President George W. Bush and President Hamid Karzai announced the creation of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council (USAWC) on January 28, 2002.\nThe Council promotes public-private partnerships between U.S. and Afghan institutions and mobilizes private sector resources to help Afghan women. Specifically, the Council seeks to identify concrete actions to bring real and practical benefits to the women of Afghanistan and to enable them to participate and take leadership roles in the political and economic life of their country.\nTo this end, the Council has made education and microfinance its top priorities.\nToo bad - under patriarchy - refuge and shelter has to be the top priority. Battered women's villages - transitional living space free from abuse is the first need. But if you are from the privileged classes, you do not understand the urgency of this need.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4292425.stm\nThe Council meets twice a year, alternating between Kabul and Washington, D.C., to discuss programs and priorities for assisting Afghan women and to review progress.\nUnder Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky co-chairs the Council with the Afghan Foreign Minister and the Afghan Minister of Women's Affairs. What are their names?\nSee http://usawc.state.gov/c10666.htm for more information about Council members.\nTake a look at these people. Not one has ever organized victims of patriarchal violence. They are so removed from that world. They are wealthy. They have fundraising credentials. There is no evaluation or input by feminists who have actually changed resistant, misogynist institutions within the US - civil rights organizers and feminist organizers with track records of success.\nThis is primarily the fault of those organizers who have refused to work with this president even to free their own kind from slavery. Would these modern day feminists have refused to support the abolitionist movement because Lincoln was a Republican? But it is also the fault of this administration who has not appointed any real feminists to the US-Afghan Women's Council to assist in the Middle East efforts.\nThe Council's fifth meeting was held in Washington, DC in the Treaty Room of the White House on June 15, 2004. Members and invited Afghan and American special guests discussed several key issues, including the Afghan national elections, health care, and jobs.\nPresident Bush, President Karzai, Secretary Powell, National Security Advisor Rice, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Thompson met with the group. First Lady Laura Bush honored the Council with a lunch.\nMore than 20 Afghan women attended the meeting and the lunch, including four Afghan Fulbright scholars (a U.S. Department of State educational exchange program), four Afghan women judges on a USAWC training project, and 12 U.S. Department of Agriculture Cochran Fellows in the U.S. for a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for job training in agribusiness.\nThe fourth meeting of the Council was held in Kabul, February 24-26, 2004.\nDiscussions focused on:\neducation, specifically the Teacher Training Institute and Afghan Literacy initiative; microfinance;\nthe new constitution;\nand the elections in Fall 2004.\nThe delegation visited a women's center and met with project managers of programs supported by the U.S. Government and by the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council.\nThe Council's third meeting, in Washington, D.C., July 15-16, 2003, focused on the educational needs of women and girls, job skills training, business development, and the upcoming elections.\nThe delegation met with First Lady Laura Bush and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice at the White House. Secretary Powell hosted a luncheon in their honor.\nAt the Council's second meeting in Kabul, the U.S. announced that it would provide $2.5 million for women's resource centers in 14 of Afghanistan's provinces. The Council also committed $1 million in education and exchange programs for the centers. The centers should include shelters for women who wish to escape abuse and become self sufficient.\nPrograms at these centers focus on basic education literacy, microfinance and small business opportunities, human rights education, and the development and management of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nInaugural Meeting\nThe inaugural meeting took place in Washington, D.C. in April 2002. In response to a request from the Afghan side, the Council later announced its first initiative would bring Afghan women who work in government ministries to the United States for an educational exchange program.\nThe program focused on computer training, leadership, and management training, and other skills vital to their positions.\nPolitical Participation Women's Resource Center.\nUSAID is building 17 Women's Resource Centers in Afghanistan.\nFour centers have been completed and two more are scheduled to finish in the near future.\nThe centers will support outreach, advocacy, and policy formation of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, and create a space in rural provinces for training women in education, health, job skills, leadership, legal awareness, and political participation.\nThrough USWAC women executives of AOL(Time Warner) donated $60,000 for the construction of the resource center in Parwan.\nAfghan Women Leaders Connect (AWLC) ($10,000).\nThis contribution supported a conference in Kabul in Fall 2004 hosted by the Women and Children Legal Research Foundation focusing on legal rights. This is in addition to the Summer 2004 grant of $10,000 that AWLC provided to the International Association of Women Judges to supplement the $75,000 grant by the State Department's International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Bureau, which trained four Afghan women judges in civil and family law.What kind of civil law? Secular? Where is it codified?\nDigital Video Conference.\nThe Council has used digital videoconference (DVC) technology to connect Kabul, Washington, DC and New York, setting up links for discussions and mentoring sessions between women in these cities.\nThe DVC in November 2003 focused on women's political participation in Afghanistan's draft constitution and the Afghan elections in 2004.\nTheDVC in April 2003 focused on the topic of women and business.\nEconomic Opportunities Community Banks.\nThe Council views microcredit as an important means of helping women gain self-sufficiency through starting their own businesses. Through an original $10,000 donation to the Council from Daimler-Chrysler, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), a leading NGO in microfinance, helped start two village banks in Herat.\nDaimler-Chrysler contributed an additional $25,000 in February 2004 to construct another five community banks to support microfinance loans for women in Herat province.\nWith Additional funding from the U.S. Government and other donors, FINCA expects to assist more than 30,000 clients in Afghanistan over the next 5 years.\nU.S. Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs/USAWC Department of State Grants ($750,000).\nFive grants were awarded to organizations for proposals that include:\nbusiness and political leadership training (grant to World Learning);\nentrepreneurship training (grant to Women for Afghan Women);\neducation and literacy training (grants to American Council for International Education and Institute for Training and Development);\nand women's leadership training (grant to University of Delaware).\nSeventy-one women have taken leadership training under the University of Delaware grant thus far.\nThunderbird Graduate School of International Management.\nFifteen Afghan women successfully completed an advanced entrepreneurship training in January 2005. The participants aim to start businesses that would create jobs for women and to serve as mentors/teachers in Afghanistan.\nGlobal Summit of Women ($40,000).\nSupported by USAID, a delegation of nine Afghan women attended the 2004 Global Summit in Seoul, Korea, in May to discuss trade opportunities and receive entrepreneurship training.\nArzu Carpet Initiative ($530,000).\nThis program provides training and literacy skills to Afghan women in the hand-knotted carpet industry. Connie Duckworth, a USAWC member, provided the seed money to get the project started. Arzu placed its first carpet order on International Women's Day (March 8, 2004). The project Arzu (which means \"Hope\" in Dari) not only creates jobs and a cottage industry, it also re-circulates some of its profits to support microcredit initiatives and additional training for women.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Cochran Fellowships.\nTwelve women representing five provinces came to the United States in Spring 2004 for job training as managers and technicians in agribusiness.\nHandicraft Training ($130,000).\nThe Global Summit of Women (July 2002 in Barcelona, Spain) donated approximately $10,000 for job-skills training for women. Through this program, Shuhada, a local organization, is training women in weaving skills. At the conclusion of the program, the women will receive their own looms to produce textiles for market. At the conclusion of the program, the women will receive their own looms to produce textiles for market. This is a big deal. Ever since the film \"Afghan Unveiled\", many people have wanted to get looms to Afghan women living in caves in the Bamiyan geographic location: Herat ? women and children who were living in caves without any source of fuel, nor livestock nor food. Nayak which does have a school for girls, built by American Friends Service Committee, is in central Afghanistan, near Bamiyan.\nIt is unclear from this fact sheet as to whether the Bamiyan women will receive the looms. More info as to how to contact Shuhada or Global Summit of Women directly would be appreciated.\nMedia Women Journalists.\nThe PBS broadcast in November 2004 of the film \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" created an opportunity for mentoring for another Afghan journalist, the fourth that PBS, through USAWC auspices, has trained in the U.S.\nPBS provided modern digital video production and editing equipment for the women video filmmakers to use in Afghanistan and training videos for use at AINA, a Kabul-based NGO devoted to media training.\nThe film \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" for which PBS paid $20,000 in royalties and rights depicts life under the Taliban and the journalist's' journey for the truth. PBS has also optioned the rights for AINA's next film about women's human rights called \"If I Stand Up.\"\nThese films and several short videos to encourage women to vote were made by the \"women's project\" at AINA with Department of State and USAID funding (from Summer 2002 through the October 2004 elections).\nThe Asia Foundation (TAF) was a partner on the original \"Afghanistan Unveiled\" project in 2002 and continues to host trainings and screenings of the film (California, Maryland and Sundance Festivals.)\nHealth Health Advisory Committee.\nOn July 26, 2004 the Council's newly formed Health Advisory Committee sponsored a special session to discuss health issues and create public/private partnerships to utilize resources for greater impact and sustainability.\nUnder Secretary Paula Dobriansky hosted the organizing meeting for the committee.\nMidwife Training.

Training will take place in the Women's Centers and will target provinces with the highest maternal mortality rates such as Ghazni, Baghlan, and Badakhshan.\nIn April 2004, REACH graduated its first 25 midwives from the program, after they completed an 18-month program in Jalalabad. This pilot program is being replicated across Afghanistan. For each new midwife, the U.S. is supporting a lifetime of lives saved.\nAfghan Family Health Book.\nIn Fall 2004, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson initiated the roll-out of the \"Afghan Family Health Book\" across Afghanistan. This \"talking book\" provides useful and practical information about health practices and hygiene, focusing on health promotion and disease prevention.\nThe books are being distributed via hospitals, clinics, and women's. The project was developed with Leapfrog Enterprises Inc., a developer, designer, and manufacturer of technology-based educational products.\nEducation Fulbright Scholarships.\nFive Afghan women were awarded Fulbright scholarships for the academic year 2004-2005 for advanced graduate-level study in the U.S. Women's Teacher Training Institute ($5 million).\nIn cooperation with USAID, First Lady Laura Bush announced a USAWC Initiative to establish a Women's Teacher Training Institute in Kabul in tandem with The Afghan Literacy Initiative, designed to help teach basic literacy to Afghan women in rural areas of Afghanistan.\nThe Institute opened in September 2004.

In turn, these women will train other teachers in Afghanistan.\nAdopt-a-school Program.\nChurch communities in Texas are providing their adopted school with supplies, textbooks, and training.\nU.S. Leadership Management and Computer Education.\nThe Council's first major program, in September and October 2002, brought 14 women from various Afghan government ministries to the United States for an educational exchange program.\nDuring their four-week stay, they received training in computer skills, proposal writing, communications, and leadership management.\nEach participant received a laptop computer to use while training in the United States and to take home to use in Afghanistan.\nThe women met with President George W. Bush and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the White House, and with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at a Department reception held in their honor.

He deserves every day of his 75-year prison sentence.\u201d\nThe District Attorney said that the defendant, Shytuan Breazil, 23, of Bristol Street, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, was today sentenced to 75 years in prison by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Vincent M. Del Guidice. The defendant was convicted of second-degree attempted murder, first-degree burglary and first-degree robbery.\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, on September 18, 2013, at about 2 p.m., the victim, Alvita Morales, 75, was in her apartment on Warren Street in the Warren Gardens/Wycoff Housing Development, when she heard a knock on the door and looked through the peephole.

When the victim tried to shut the door, he shoved her to the floor and forced his way into the apartment.\nOnce inside the apartment, according to trial testimony, the defendant demanded money and the victim told him she had $40 in her purse. He then took a large knife from her kitchen and put it in his pocket. The victim began to scream and the defendant placed his hand over her mouth and proceeded to stab her repeatedly. He then rifled through her belongings, stopping to check on her before leaving the apartment. The victim testified that she played dead, but after he left the apartment she managed to drag herself out into the hallway. A neighbor called 911. The defendant was soon identified and arrested the next day.\nThe victim sustained 15 stab wounds throughout her body including one to her neck and chest, as well as a fractured orbital bone in her right eye and two fractured ribs.\nThe case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Kori A.

His ability to go beyond the nuts and bolts of a particular proposal and identify the way it folds into the manner in which Washington does business as well as ferret out the hidden games and agendas is unmatched. That\u2019s why you should read his latest post on the President\u2019s new budget proposal.\nWhen you do take a look at it pay particular attention to the section the debt trigger that Mr. Obama is putting forth. This is the fail-safe device which will presumably save us when the parties are unable to come to any sort of agreement. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it during the speech but it popped up this morning in a post by Ezra Klein and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this isn\u2019t a key goal. Here\u2019s Klein on the trigger:\nWhether you assume we have till mid-May or early June, that\u2019s not enough time for Republicans to rethink their position on taxes and nor for Democrats to come around to privatizing Medicare. So there\u2019s going to have to be some placeholder attached to the debt ceiling vote. The \u2018trigger\u2019 attached to Obama\u2019s budget is a likely candidate. If we\u2019re not on a better fiscal path come 2014, it begins indiscriminately slicing away at a large swath of the federal budget and, importantly, at tax expenditures. So, in theory at least, it puts us on the path to deficit reduction without requiring us to make the hard decisions of deficit reduction right this minute. That\u2019s probably the likeliest immediate outcome of all of these plans and proposals.\nGot that? No agreement on anyone\u2019s plan by the time we get to the debt ceiling drop dead date so both sides agree to the trigger mechanism. Presumably we fight this through the election and barring some huge mandate for change one way or the other, go back to fighting about the same subject in 2013 and assuming no compromise rely on the trigger to do the dirty work.\nAs Hennessey points out, there is a rather large bias in the trigger:\nThe President\u2019s proposal is similar to past triggers in that it exempts all discretionary spending, Social Security, and interest on the debt. While past triggers limited the amounts that Medicare and Medicaid could be cut, the President\u2019s trigger appears to exempt them entirely. The White House fact sheet says the trigger \u201cshould not apply to Social Security, low-income programs, or Medicare benefits.\u201d Elsewhere it says the trigger applies only to mandatory spending.\nAssuming that \u201clow-income programs\u201d includes Medicaid, this means the trigger appears to apply to at most about $300 B (if triggered this year) in \u201cother mandatory\u201d spending. Half of that would hit federal retiree payments, a quarter would hit veterans\u2019 benefits (if not defined as \u201clow income\u201d), and the rest would hit smaller things like farm subsidies.\nIt therefore appears that the President\u2019s trigger would exempt more than 90% of government spending from the automatic across-the-board cut.\nThe trigger would also raise taxes by implementing \u201cacross-the-board spending reductions \u2026 [in] spending through the tax code.\u201d In other words, the trigger would somehow (how??) automatically reduce tax expenditures across-the-board (rather than raising rates, it appears). No past trigger has included a tax increase. This is new.\nThe fog lifts. The across-the-board trigger would apply to less than 10% of federal spending and would also raise taxes. And since it would apply only to itemized deductions, it\u2019s only going to hit a portion of those paying income taxes, which is only a portion of all Americans.\nThe trigger is, in effect, a tax increase trigger on those who itemize deductions, with a little other mandatory spending thrown in for good measure.\nThe overwhelming impact of the trigger would be to raise taxes on those who itemize. A much smaller portion of triggered deficit reduction would come from automatic spending cuts.\nWhen you combine the automatic nature of this policy with the absence of specific policies needed to sufficiently reduce spending in the long run, the effect of this trigger would be to shift the burden of future entitlement spending increases away from deficits and onto higher income taxpayers. The future default would be that entitlement spending would grow at an unsustainable rate, and taxes on \u201cthe rich\u201d would grow to hold deficits below 3% of GDP.\nHe notes correctly that structured as it appears to be, the trigger rewards those who favor increased spending financed by higher taxes to stonewall on budget cuts.\nKeep an eye on this particular feature of the President\u2019s proposal. If it does end up as a compromise feature of a debt ceiling increase, you can expect the Democrats to go into full stall mode. Assuming the President is reelected, they can continue to fight any significant spending cuts, justifying their actions by pointing to the trigger as the mechanism which will mediate irreconcilable differences.\nApril 13, 2011 Obama Delivers A Political Speech Not A Plan (74)\nApril 10, 2013 Budget Battles (0)\nMarch 7, 2009 Is Obama A Radical?

Diccon Bewes is a British travel writer who lives in Switzerland, and during research he came across a diary from a young Englishwoman, Jemima Morrell, who, as part of a group who called themselves the Junior United Alpine Club, travelled on the very first Thomas Cook tour to Switzerland in 1863. The group consisted of four young women and three young men, and included Jemima's brother William, who paid for both of them.\nBewes determined to follow as much as possible in her footsteps, following the route she took, staying in the same places and visiting the same sights as much as possible. Near the beginning of the book is a map of the Cook tour from 1863 which took place from June 26th to July 15th, and included travel by rail, diligence, foot, mule, and steamship. With Thomas Cook the company that launched modern mass tourism, and by the time I finished the book going into bankruptcy, this book looks at travel from an interesting vantage point. Bewes took the trip with his mother, going back to certain points at a later date on his own.\nAppendices include: a brief description of the world in 1863, and a timeline of that year showing some important events that occured; a summary, including data points of Switzerland in the 1860s with information on language spoken, size of towns, birth and death rates, wages and prices, and occupations; and descriptions and explanations on money of the time, both English and Swiss their modern equivalencies.\nAs he followed Jemima's journey, he and his mother read sections from the diary at each point in their journey, and while many of the lodgings that she stayed in no longer existed, a few did. Some sections of the journey are now done by train, where there weren't trains back then, and Jemima's journey definitely involved longer and more difficult travel times. Some of her days were exceedingly long, and many of the places she stayed didn't offer the modern conveniences now available.\nDewes shows the differences between the two experiences plainly, from the modes of travel, to the the time travelling took, to the things one was able to see at each point in the journey. He shows the huge changes that have taken place in the tourism industry in Switzerland, and talks about the drivers of those changes. He discusses changes to the physical environment, from the buildings and food on offer to the shrinking of the snow caps and glaciers. He follows up at the end with a look at what became of Jemima after this journey and the discovery of a personal connection to her family.\nThis was a fascinating and educational read, and hugely entertaining.\nLabels: History, Journeys, Memoirs, Switzerland, Travel, Writers\nNutcracker Night\nTears of Salt\nTriceratops Stomp\nThe Castle in the Sea\nThe Corner That Held Them\nMy Drowning\nA Better Man\nMurder in Passy\nBody Bereft\nMrs. Saint and the Defectives\n13th Canadian Book Challenge October Roundup", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 301, "original_length": 32561, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.98, "perplexity": 258.6, "bucket": "head"}

Immunization and States: The Politics of Making Vaccines explores vaccine geopolitics, analyzing why, and how this move happened, before looking at the ramifications in the context of Covid-19.\nThis unique book uses eight country studies \u2013 looking at Croatia, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and Sweden \u2013 to explore the role of public sector vaccine institutes, past and present. Raising questions about national sovereignty, the erosion of multilateralism, and geopolitics, it also contributes to debates around public interest and privatization in the health sector. An extended introduction sets the chapters in an international context, whilst the epilogue looks forward to the future of vaccine development and production.\nThis is an important book for students, scholars, and practitioners with an interest in vaccine development from a range of fields, including public health, medicine, science and technology studies, history of medicine, politics, international relations, and the sociology of health and illness.\n15/01/23 - 22/01/2312\n08/01/23 - 15/01/237", "cc_segment": "crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2023-06/segments/1674764494826.88/wet/CC-MAIN-20230126210844-20230127000844-00000.warc.wet.gz", "original_nlines": 566, "original_length": 13557, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.84, "perplexity": 224.8, "bucket": "head"}

Bank credit grew at 12.64 percent year-on-year to Rs 85.511 lakh crore (US$ 1,326.78 billion) on May 11, 2018, from Rs. 75.91 lakh crore (US$ 1,131.47) on May 12, 2017.\nThe bank recapitalization plan by Government of India is expected to push credit growth in the country to 15 percent and as a result, help the GDP grow by 7 percent in FY19. Enhanced spending on infrastructure, speedy implementation of projects and continuation of reforms are expected to provide further impetus to growth. All these factors suggest that India\u2019s banking sector is also poised for robust growth as the rapidly growing business would turn to banks for their credit needs.\nNBFC Regulations: Evolution, rationalization & challenges ahead\nSpeaker: Mr. Shivaji Dhekane | Deputy Vice President - Analytics, Tata Capital\nNon-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are companies engaged in the business of loans and advances that form an important and integral part of the Indian financial system. They play an important role in nation building and financial inclusion by complementing the commercial banking sector in making credit available to the unbanked segments of society, especially to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for the majority of non-agricultural employment in the country. In terms of financial assets, NBFCs have recorded a healthy growth of 19% CAGR over the past few years and its share in total credit is expected to grow to 20% by 2020 from 13% in 2015.\nWith the growing importance of data-driven decisions, technology can enable NBFCs to more efficiently serve their customers. Some of the applications include lending based on data from mobile phone records, the rise of social media scoring, assessing of the customer\u2019s propensity to repay the loans. These are also referred to as alternative data scoring.\nNBFCs can realize the potential value of alternative data by making investments in technology and analytics to leverage both traditional and non-traditional data sources. This will enable a healthy competition, increase product innovation, and also further the government goal of increasing financial inclusion.\nChallenges still exist for NBFCs as the financial sector sees a rapid transformation. Owing to the lighter regulations on NBFCs, globally they have been seen to take up high leverage and sub-credit assets thus risking the health of their assets. Another issue is with respect to the convergence of the regulations of banks and NBFCs. Though it has improved in the recent iterations to regulations, further convergence is desired. The NBFCs act as a catalyst to the development of the country and is therefore important to nurture and actively manage their health.\nRedefining the lines: Growing influence of FinTechs on Indian Financial services and the challenges\nSpeaker: Mr. Nayan Mehta | Chief Financial Officer, Bombay Stock Exchange\nFintech refers to financial technology that describes an emerging financial services sector in the 21st century. Originally, the term applied to technology applied to the back-end of established consumer and trade financial institutions. Since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the term has expanded to include any technological innovation in the financial sector, including innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies like bitcoin.\nSince the internet revolution and the mobile internet revolution, however, financial technology has grown explosively, and fintech, which originally referred to computer technology applied to the back office of banks or trading firms, now describes a broad variety of technological interventions into personal and commercial finance. According to EY, Fintech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.\nTrends in Digital Lending\nSpeaker: Mr. Ashish Desai| Senior Vice President and Head - Product and Payments, Aditya Birla Payments Bank\nDigital Lending enables borrowers to apply for any consumer or business lending product (credit card, line of credit, mortgage, business loan) 24x7 from any internet connected device, at any location, any time of the day.
